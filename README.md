# 🗺️ React Native Maps Testing Example

This is a minimal example project demonstrating **how to write unit tests with `react-native-maps`** in a **React Native + Expo** app.

Created using [`create-expo-app`](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-new-app/), this project sets up mocks and test configuration to allow smooth testing of map-based components.

### Run Unit Tests

```bash
npm run test
```

### Run the app on Android

npm run android
```

Make sure you have an Android emulator running or a device connected.

## What This Example Covers

- Mocking react-native-maps for unit testing
- Using `@testing-library/react-native` for rendering and firing events
- Proper Jest setup for React Native components
